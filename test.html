<center><h2>Hello. This is JCM Systems.</h2></center>

<p>JCM Systems is a UK-based system and service consultancy.

<p><strong>We build systems, which build systems, which build systems</strong>.

<p>We work with Cloud Foundry, Concourse, BOSH, AWS, GCP, and other Cloud
Native technologies.

<p>But rather than focussing on the specific technologies we like to use, let's
explain why you might want us to lend a hand ...

<p>Think of a system that you care about - one that actual people use.

<p>Perhaps it's your e-commerce system. Perhaps it's your messaging system.

<p>Whatever it is, I'm sure you want it to work well, evolving and changing as
it becomes successful and profitable.

<p>Now think about the systems that allow that system to exist. Is a "platform" one of them?

<p>Lastly, think of all the systems that enable that platform:

<ul>
<li><p>the CI/CD that deploys the platform safely
<li><p>the monitoring and alerting which lets you sleep at night
<li><p>the logging and operational metrics which help diagnose problems
</ul>

<p>All those systems you've just brought to mind have parallel human systems:
the teams that develop, deploy and run them.

<p><strong>JCM Systems helps organisations design, build, operate and iterate all these
systems: the human systems and the technological systems</strong>.

<p>We using our experience of the patterns of interaction that make the
difference between effective systems and less-effective ones.

<p>We help organisations avoid costly missteps as they begin, as they grow, and
as they succeed.
